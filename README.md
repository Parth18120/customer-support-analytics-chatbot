# Customer Support Analytics Chatbot

## Overview
This project is a simple NLP chatbot built using **Python** and **Flask**.  
The goal was to experiment with natural language processing and build a small application that can answer common customer questions automatically.

The chatbot classifies user questions into different **intents** and returns the appropriate response.  
User interactions are logged so they can be analyzed later to understand common questions and improve responses.

This project helped me practice working with **text data, machine learning models, and building a small web application**.

## Features
- NLP-based intent classification
- Confidence scoring for predictions
- Fallback response when confidence is low
- Simple web interface using Flask
- Logging of user interactions
- Basic analytics on chatbot conversations

---

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Flask
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- HTML / CSS
- JSON for training data

---

## How It Works
1. The user enters a question in the chatbot interface.
2. The text is cleaned and converted into features using **CountVectorizer**.
3. A **Multinomial Naive Bayes** model predicts the intent of the question.
4. If the prediction confidence is high enough, the chatbot returns the appropriate response.
5. If confidence is low, a fallback message is shown.
6. The interaction is logged so it can be analyzed later.

## Example Use Case
This chatbot could be used for:

- Answering common FAQ questions  
- Customer support automation  
- Internal helpdesk assistants  

It can also be extended with more training data or connected to external APIs.

## Future Improvements
Some things I would like to improve in the future:

- Deploy the chatbot online
- Improve intent classification using more advanced NLP models
- Store conversations in a database
- Build a dashboard to visualize chatbot analytics
